- Supports only XAuth protocol (if there is need for PIN based OAuth I will include it)
- OAuth tokens must be set in oauth.cpp line 27 and 28 to work properly
- Uses QJson library by Flavio Castelli for parsing JSON responses
- JSON parsing is done in multithreaded way using QThreadPool
- User Streams support is not completed (fetches responses correctly, JSON parsing is not full implemented)

Requirements and dependencies:
- Qt needs to be compiled with OpenSSL support (there are two places where is used https protocol)
